## Installation

### Via Node Palette (Recommended)

1. In n8n, click the **+** button to open the node palette
2. Search for **Directus**
3. Click the verified Directus node (look for the verification badge / shield icon)
4. Click **Install**

This is the recommended path because it installs the verified community node with the correct signature. Avoid installing by package name through **Settings → Community Nodes** — that path can produce a "Package is not vetted for installation" error.

### Self-Hosted n8n: Enable Community Nodes

If the Directus node doesn't appear when you search the palette, enable community packages:

1. Set `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED=true` in your n8n environment variables
2. Restart your n8n instance

### Docker: Persist the Nodes Directory

If your installed community nodes disappear after container restarts, ensure `~/.n8n/nodes` is in a persistent volume:

```yaml
volumes:
  - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n
```

### Via npm (Advanced)

```bash
cd ~/.n8n/nodes
npm install n8n-nodes-directus
```

For more information, visit the [Community Nodes documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/).

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Directus Credentials

1. In n8n, go to **Credentials** → **New**
2. Search for **Directus API**
3. Enter your Directus URL and authentication details

#### Static Token (Recommended)
```
URL: https://your-directus-instance.com
Static Token: your-api-token
```

#### OAuth2
```
URL: https://your-directus-instance.com
Client ID: your-client-id
Client Secret: your-client-secret
```

### 2. Add Directus Node to Workflow

1. Create a new workflow
2. Add a **Directus** node
3. Select your credentials
4. Choose a resource and operation
5. Configure parameters
6. Execute!

### 3. Example: Create a User

```
Resource: Users
Operation: Create
Email: newuser@example.com
Password: SecurePassword123!
Role: Editor  ← Use role name (not UUID!)
Status: active
```

## Authentication

### Creating a Directus API Token

1. Log into your Directus admin panel
2. Go to **Users** and select (or create) the user your workflow will authenticate as
3. Open the user's detail page and scroll to the **Token** section
4. Click **Generate Token**
5. Copy the token
6. **Click the checkmark (✓) to save the user** — the token is not stored until you save
7. Paste the token into your n8n credentials

### Choosing the Right Role

**Admin Token (Recommended for getting started)** — Assign the Administrator role for full access. Many operations (including webhook creation for triggers) require admin permissions.

**Custom Role (Recommended for production)** — Create a role with only the permissions your workflows need. The token inherits the user's role, so you can restrict access while keeping workflows functional.

Suggested permissions for AI agents and automation:
- **directus_users**: Create, Read, Update
- **directus_roles**: Read
- **directus_flows**: Read, Execute
- **directus_activity**: Read
- **Your collections**: As needed

## AI Agent Integration

### Pre-built AI Tools

This package includes ready-to-use tools for n8n AI agents:

1. **User Management Tools**
   - `create_directus_user` - Create users with role names
   - `query_directus_users` - Search and filter users
   - `update_directus_user` - Modify user details

2. **Flow Automation Tools**
   - `trigger_directus_flow` - Execute flows with payload
   - `monitor_flow_execution` - Check flow status
   - `get_flow_logs` - Retrieve execution logs

3. **Data Query Tools**
   - `query_with_preset` - Use saved filter presets
   - `query_activity_logs` - Access activity data
   - `aggregate_activity` - Generate statistics

### Quick Agent Setup

1. Import an [example workflow](./examples/workflows/)
2. Configure Directus credentials
3. Connect to your AI model (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
4. Customize the system prompt
5. Test with natural language commands!

Example interaction:
```
User: "Create an editor account for sarah@company.com"
Agent: [Creates user, triggers welcome email flow]
       "Done! User created with ID xyz. Welcome email sent."
```

See the [AI Agent Setup Guide](./docs/agent-setup-guide.md) for detailed instructions.

## Flow Automation

### Triggering Flows

Execute Directus automation workflows from n8n:

```
Resource: Flows
Operation: Trigger
Flow ID: welcome-email  ← Can use name or UUID
Payload: {
  "user_email": "newuser@example.com",
  "user_name": "New User"
}
Execution Mode: sync  ← Wait for completion
```

### Monitoring Flows

Track flow execution status:

```
Resource: Activity
Operation: Get
Activity ID: {{ execution_id }}
```

### Flow Examples

- **User Onboarding**: Create user → Trigger welcome email → Add to CRM
- **Content Publishing**: Update status → Trigger notification → Post to social media
- **Data Sync**: Fetch external data → Process → Update Directus

## Examples

### Example Workflows
